# Photo Portfolio Summer 2025 Project

**TODO:**

* Start figuring what portfolio.html will look like.
* Figure out CSS styling for the "Portfolio", "About", and "Contact" links.
* First Milestone: Create functional but completely static site using just HTML and CSS.
* Second Milestone: Add JS to make site more dynamic and have more features (e.g., filtering images by category etc)
* Add icon image
