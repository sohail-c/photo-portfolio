          <h2> My Photography Portfolio</h2>
          <p>Hello! This site is a work-in-progress project for summer 2025. </p>
          <p>I've been meaning to create a photography portfolio for a long time now and decided to 
             finally bite the bullet and try to do it this summer and make it a learning experience as well.</p>
          <p>My goal is to create this site using only plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm also going to be doing this project entirely in neovim as a way to try to learn the text editor and see if it is the right one for me.</p> 
        <p>Lastly, I'm also going to be trying to use LLMs like ChatGPT and Gemini as resources for this project rather than just searching for it on the web. AI is definitely the direction the industry is going and I feel like I need to get on the train so this project is one way I'm trying to get slightly more comfortable with using LLMs.</p>
          <p>A stretch goal is to, after having created a functioning portfolio, to try to recreate it using modern web technologies like React and see what the differences between the two are.</p>
