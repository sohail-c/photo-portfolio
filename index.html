          <p>Hello! This site is a work-in-progress project for summer 2025. </p>
          <p>I've been meaning to create a photography portfolio for a long time now and decided to 
             finally bite the bullet and try to do it this summer and make it a learning experience as well.</p>
          <p>My goal is to create this site using only plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm also going to be doing this project entirely in neovim as a way to try to learn the text editor and see if it is the right one for me. </p>
          <p>A stretch goal is to, after having created a functioning portfolio, to try to recreate it using modern web technologies like React and see what the differences between the two are.</p>
